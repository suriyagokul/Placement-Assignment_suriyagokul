Functional Components:

    Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions.
    They receive props as a parameter and return JSX/elements.
    Functional components are simpler and easier to read and write.
    They do not have access to the React lifecycle methods or state management.
    They are primarily used for simpler UI components or for components that do not require complex logic.
  
    We have access to hooks like useState, useEffect,useContext...
    
    
Class Components:

    Class components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class.
    They have access to the React lifecycle methods and state management through the this keyword.
    Class components can have a more complex structure and handle more advanced logic.
    They are used when components need to manage state, utilize lifecycle methods, or handle more complex behavior.
