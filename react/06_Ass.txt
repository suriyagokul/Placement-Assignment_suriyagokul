Lifecycle methods in React are special methods that are invoked at different stages of a component's life, from its initialization to its removal from the DOM.


    Initialization: Lifecycle methods like constructor() and componentWillMount() allow for initializing the component's state, setting default props, 
    and performing any necessary setup before rendering.

    Side Effects: Lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount() and componentDidUpdate() provide a way to interact with the browser's DOM or perform other side effects. 
    For example, making API calls, subscribing to events, or updating the document title.

    Performance Optimization: Lifecycle methods like shouldComponentUpdate() allow developers to control whether a component should re-render or not. 
    By implementing custom logic in this method, unnecessary re-renders can be avoided, improving performance.

    Cleanup: The componentWillUnmount() method allows developers to clean up resources, event listeners, 
    or cancel pending requests before a component is removed from the DOM.
