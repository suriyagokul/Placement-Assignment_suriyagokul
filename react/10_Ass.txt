The useReducer is a React Hook that provides an alternative way to manage state in functional components. 
It is often used as an alternative to the useState Hook when state logic becomes more complex or involves multiple related values. 


      Complex state management: 
      
          useReducer allows you to manage more complex state logic by using a reducer function. 
          The reducer function takes the current state and an action as inputs and returns a new state. 
          This is especially useful when state transitions depend on the previous state or when the state has a complex structure.

      Predictable state updates: 
      
          The useReducer pattern enforces a more predictable way to update state. 
          By dispatching actions to the reducer function, you can clearly define how state should change in response to certain actions. 
          This can make debugging and understanding state updates easier.
