Prop drilling is a term used in software development, specifically in the context of React or other component-based frameworks, 
to describe the process of passing down props (properties) through multiple levels of nested components in order to reach a component that actually needs them. 


Prop drilling can lead to several issues, including:

    Code complexity: As the number of components and the depth of nesting increases, the process of passing down props becomes cumbersome and 
    can make the codebase more difficult to maintain and understand.

    Maintenance challenges: If a prop needs to be changed or updated, it may require modifying multiple components that are involved in the prop drilling process, 
    even if they don't directly use the prop. This can introduce potential errors and increase the effort required for maintenance.
    
    
To avoid prop drilling, there are several techniques and patterns you can apply:

      Context API: React's Context API allows you to create a context object that can be accessed by nested components without explicitly passing props through
      each intermediate component. Context provides a way to share data between components without the need for explicit prop passing. 
      By defining the context at a higher level and consuming it where needed, you can avoid prop drilling.

      State management libraries: Utilizing state management libraries like Redux or MobX can help centralize and manage the application's state, 
      making it accessible to any component in the component tree without prop drilling. These libraries provide a global state store that can be accessed from any component.
