Call Stack: It is a data structure that keeps track of function calls and their execution context. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack, and when it completes, it is popped off from it.

A callback queue, also known as the task queue or message queue, is a data structure that holds callbacks and tasks that need to be executed in the future.

Micro Task Queue is specifically designed to handle microtasks, which are functions scheduled to run immediately after the current task but before rendering or other tasks.
