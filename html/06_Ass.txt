Advantages of HTML5:

1) Improved multimedia support: HTML5 introduced new elements and APIs for handling multimedia content, such as audio and video, without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

2)Native support for graphics and animations: HTML5 brought the <canvas> element, which allows for drawing graphics and animations directly within the browser without plugins.

3) Enhanced form controls: HTML5 introduced new input types (e.g., email, date, range) and attributes that make form handling more robust and user-friendly.

4) Mobile device support: HTML5 was designed with mobile devices in mind, offering better support for responsive design and touch-based interactions.
