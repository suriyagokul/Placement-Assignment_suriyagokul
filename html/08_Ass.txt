<img> tag: It is used to embed an image into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag and requires the "src" attribute to specify the image source. Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">.

<figure> tag: It is used to group together media content, typically an image, with a caption. It provides a semantic structure for a self-contained piece of content. 

Ex- <figure>
        <img src="nature.jpg" alt="nature">
        <figcaption>Cool Environment</figcaption>
    </figure>
